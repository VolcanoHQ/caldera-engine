Caldera Engine Scene Director (Layer 3: Production Direction)

Consumes a Tier 1 enriched ManuscriptManifest (Chain A output) plus the per-book
tier1 pipeline artifacts, and produces per-scene production direction:
music (mood/style/stingers), scene environment, and delivery notes -- then builds
generation-ready prompts (MusicGen/AudioGen/image models) and syncs the whole
production knowledge record into MemPalace.

Outputs (data/corpus/pipeline/{book}/tier3/):
  production_script.json   machine-readable full direction
  production_script.txt    human-readable, same format as HumanProcessed Tier 3 gold
  generation_prompts.json  per-scene prompts for downstream media generation (Chain C/E)
